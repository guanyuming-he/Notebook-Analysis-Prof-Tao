\section*{General Principles}
This section describes the overall principles of the document: in what style and format it is typeset,
in what structure this document is written, and so forth.

\subsection*{Definitions}
\begin{description}
\item[The document] The phrase \emph{the document} means this document (what you are reading) itself.
\item[The book] The phrase \emph{the book} represents Tao's \emph{Analysis} (both volume I and II).
\end{description}

\subsection*{Indices}
The book has two volumes: 
\emph{Analysis I} and \emph{Analysis II}. We may notice that the indices of the two volumes both start 
from 1. It may lead to some confusions. So in the document, the indices are organized in such a way that:
If the content comes from \emph{Analysis I}, the corresponding index is the same as the book's. 
Otherwise, the corresponding index is prefixed with ``2.''.

For example, Exercise 3.1.3 in \emph{Analysis I} is indexed as Exercise 3.1.3 in the document, but 
Exercise 3.1.3 in \emph{Analysis II} is indexed as Exercise 2.3.1.3.

\subsection*{Notations}
Professor Tao uses many kinds of statements: Theorems, Propositions, Lemmas, etc. However, in this document, I will use them, too. Therefore, to distinguish between his and my statements,
I will prepend all my statements with ``My''. For example, Proposition 2.2.1 in this document will be written as My Proposition 2.2.1 in this document.

\subsection*{Abbreviations}
We often leave off some descriptions for a number's properties. For example, we may refer a 
\emph{positive natural number} $n$ as a \emph{positive number} when we haven't learned the rationals and 
the reals.
