\maketitle

This document serves as a notebook for Prof Terence Tao's \emph{Analysis, Fourth Edition}. I write it mainly to record all the solutions I make to the exercises. Along the way, I also write down important propositions and my thoughts that Prof Tao didn't mention in the book.

\newpage
Thank my parents for, despite the financial challenges and the differences in our views of the world, supporting my education.

Thank Prof.~Tao for writing this amazing book and providing many insightful blogs/talks/papers that inspired me to be persistent and think better about maths.

Finally, thank God; Jesus Christ be praised.
